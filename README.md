A simple adventure game by {who?} based on a simple adventure game engine by [Adam Smith](https://github.com/rndmcnlly).

Code requirements:
- **4+ scenes based on `AdventureScene`**: Dunes, Pyramid, Ship, Heart
- **2+ scenes *not* based on `AdventureScene`**: Intro, Consumed, Destroyed
- **2+ methods or other enhancement added to the adventure game engine to simplify my scenes**:
    - Enhancement 1: `flicker(obj)`: adds a random flickering effect to an instance of glow FX
    - Enhancement 2: `bob(obj)`: adds a bobbing tween effect to an object
    - Enhancement e: `reveal(obj)`: adds. tween to increases the opacity of an object

Experience requirements:
- **4+ locations in the game world**: The Dunes, The Oceanic Pyramid, The Sunken Ship, The Heart
- **2+ interactive objects in most scenes**: 
- **Many objects have `pointerover` messages**: unsatisfied (describe two examples)
- **Many objects have `pointerdown` effects**: unsatisfied (describe two examples)
- **Some objects are themselves animated**: unsatisfied (describe two examples)
